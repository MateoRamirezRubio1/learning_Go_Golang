# Learning Go (Golang)

Welcome to the **Learning Go (Golang)** repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring various concepts, techniques, and best practices in Go programming. Each folder within this repository will focus on a specific topic or project, complete with source code and a corresponding blog post that explains the concepts in detail.

## Current Structure

### 1. Parallelism and Concurrency

- **File:** `parallel_map_filter_reduce.go`
- **Description:** This file demonstrates how to implement parallel operations like `Map`, `Filter`, and `Reduce` in Go using Goroutines, Mutexes, and WaitGroups. It serves as a practical example of how to leverage parallelism to improve the performance and efficiency of your Go applications.

- **Blog Post:** [Quick Introduction to Parallel Computing in Go: A Practical Approach with Goroutines, WaitGroups, Mutexes and Atomic Operations](https://medium.com/@matteo.dcj/introduction-to-parallelism-in-go-goroutines-mutexes-waitgroups-e8c5b3f35a1a)
- **Link File:** [Code](https://github.com/MateoRamirezRubio1/learning_Go_Golang/blob/main/parallelismAndConcurrency/parallel_map_filter_reduce.go)

## Future Additions

This repository is a work in progress. In the future, more folders and files will be added to cover a wide range of Go programming topics. Each new topic will be accompanied by a detailed blog post to help you understand the concepts better.
